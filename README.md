Navkeys.JS
==========

Navkeys is a fledgling project meant to make it easy to bring
keyboard navigation control to existing websites. 

The current code is functional but extremely limited. This is a fun & learning project for me.
Watchers are welcome to hack away behind me, but I won't be accepting pull requests at this time.
